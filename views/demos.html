	<p class='desc'><strong>What is it? - </strong> simuL8r is self explanatory once you see the demos, its basically a physics engine that lets users create fun and interactive scenes, <br>
	eventually when the app is complete it be should be possible to use it to make simple games.</p>
	<p class='desc'><strong>This page - </strong> This project is still at an early stage, and many of the features have yet to be built but the purpose of this page<br>
	 is to act as a demonstration for the kind of things that can be already made with this app.</p>
	<p class='desc'><strong>Instructions - </strong> simply click on any of the thumbnails below to access a demo, and follow the instructions when you get there (its very simple, just click the play button)</p>
	<p class='desc'><strong>Create your own scenes - </strong> select the <span style='font-weight: bold; color: #00008B;'>"make a scene!"</span> tab on the left hand navigation and when you get to the canvas hover over the icons to learn how they work.</p>
